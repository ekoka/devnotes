- every file on a linux system is owned by a user and a group

- in addition there are 3 types of access permissions: read, write, and execute 

- different access permissions can be applied to a file's owning user, owning group, and others (those without ownership).

- file owners and permissions can be viewed from the the long listing format of the `ls` command
    
    $ ls -l /media/

    total 16
    drwxrwx--- 1 root vboxsf 16384 Jan 29 11:02 sf_Shared

- it's also possible to use the `stat` command

    # owning user
    $ stat -c %U /media/sf_Shared

    root

    # owning group
    $ stat -c %G /media/sf_Shared

    vboxsf

    # access rights
    $ stat -c %A /media/sf_Shared

    drwxrwx---

- Access permissions are displayed in three groups of characters
    
    drwxrwx---

    - the first character represents the file's type

- to list files owned by a user or group, use the find utility

    # find / -group <groupname>
    # find / -user <user>

- a file's owning user and group can be changed with the `chown` command 

   # chown new_owner file_name 
   # chown new_owner:new_group file_name 

- a file's access permission can be changed with chmod (see notes)
