## useradd command

    useradd -m -G <additional-groups> -s <login_shell> <username>

- useful options
    -m | --create-home : user's home dir is created at /home/username
    -M | --no-create-home
    -G | --groups : comma separated list of supplementary groups
    -s | --shell: a path to the user's login shell (must be installed and path in /etc/shells).
    -d | --home-dir
    -g | -gid: specify primary group 
    -p | --password
    -c | --comment: usually the full name
    -r | --system: create a system account
    -U | --user-group: create a group with same name as username and add user to it (default behavior)

- if main group is specified with -g it must exist. Else the behavior is defined in /etc/login.def. Usually a group with the same name as the username is created for each new user.
- creating each user with their own group (the default) is the preferred way to add users.

- nologin shell 
The /usr/bin/nologin shell can be specified if the account is not meant to log in to a shell (e.g. it was created for a specific service) 

- system users can be used to run processes/daemons under a different user, thus protecting files and directories. 

    e.g. creating a system user with no shell access, no home 

    # useradd -r -s /etc/usr/bin/nologin <username>

## add user to group
    
    set supplemental groups (deleting old groups)
    #   useradd/usermod -G admin,dev,www mike 

    add supplemental groups (without deleting old ones)
    #   useradd/usermod -a -G newgroup mike 

    setting primary group
    #   useradd/usermod -g admin mike


## delete user
    -r (remove home dir) 

    #   userdel -r mike

## change password

    #   passwd [mike]


## add new group

    #   groupadd newgroup
