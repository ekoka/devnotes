## installation
`su` is part of the `util-linux` package

## usage
 
    # su [username] 

- default username is "root"

## login shell
- default behavior is to remain within the current directory and to maintain the environment variables of original user (rather than switch to those of new user) 

- it's advisable that administrative users, as well as any users authorized to use `su` acquire the habit of always running the `su` command with the `-l|--login` option.

- the `--login` option has 2 effects:
    - it switches from the current directory to the home directory of the new user, by logging in as that user. 
    - it changes the environment variables to those of the new user, as dictated by their preferred shell settings.

- thus admins should generally use `su` as follows 

    $ su -l 
    $ su -l archie

- you may wish to add an alias to `.bashrc` for this

    alias su="su -l"

- BSD `su` allows only members of the "wheel" group to assume root's identity by default. This is not the default behavior of GNU `su`, but can be mimicked  using PAM. 
    - uncomment the appropriate line in `/etc/pam.d/su` and `/etc/pam.d/su-l`
