- before editing a partition table get a list of partitions

    # fdisk -l

    or

    # lsblk -f

    or 

    # blkid

- start parted on a volume or disk

    # parted /dev/sda
    (parted)

- get help

    (parted) help

- list partitions

    (parted) print all

- remove a partition

    (parted) rm NUMBER

where NUMBER is the number obtained from the previously printed list.

- create a new disklabel (i.e. a partition table)

    (parted) mklabel LABEL-TYPE

    # or 

    (parted) mktable LABEL-TYPE

you likely want "gpt" as the label type for a modern approach on a computer that can support it, else choose "msdos" to create a master boot record (MBR)

    (parted> mklabel gpt

    # for MBR 
    (parted> mklabel msdos

- creating partitions with `mkpart`

    - The syntax for GPT partitions:

        (parted) mkpart PART-LABEL FS-TYPE START END

    PART-LABEL is the label for the partition. START and END can be specified by approximation (in %) or in exact locations (KiB, MiB, GiB). `parted` may sometimes suggest to adjust the size slightly.

    - example of a partitioning scheme
    You need an UEFI partition to boot (aka ESP partition) 

        (parted) mkpart "EFI System Partition" fat32 1mib 261mib 
        # find out number associated with the new partition
        (parted) print list
        # then set the "esp" flag on the partition using its number
        (parted) set NUMBER esp on

    You can then make the root partition take the remaining space

        (parted) mkpart "root partition" ext 261mib 100%

    or you can divide the space into multiple partitions to be mounted later

        # 20 gig root partition 
        (parted) mkpart "root partition" ext4 261mib 20.5gig
        # 4 gig swap partition 
        (parted) mkpart "swap partition" linux-swap 20.5gig 24.5gig
        # home partition takes the remaining space
        (parted) mkpart "home partition" ext4 24.5gig 100%

    - The `mkpart` syntax for MBR partitions is slightly different

        (parted) mkpart PART-TYPE FS-TYPE START END

    PART-TYPE here can be any of "primary", "logical", "extended"

- formatting the partitions

    - format the EFI partition

        # mkfs.fat -F32 /dev/sda1

    - format the swap partition (if applicable)
        # mkswap /dev/sda2

    - format the ext4 partitions
        # mkfs.ext4 /dev/sda3
        # mkfs.ext4 /dev/sda4
