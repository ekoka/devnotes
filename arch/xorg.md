## Install

    `pacman -S xorg-server`

- some packages from the `xorg-apps` group are also necessary for certain configuration tasks.

## Running
- the `Xorg` command is usually not run directly. Instead the X server is started by a display manager or `xinit` (i.e. you usually want to install a window manager or desktop environment along with X).
