- before making changes to a hard disk, you may want to backup the partition table and partition scheme of the drive.

- the backup can also be used to copy the same partition layout to numerous drives.

- for both GPT and MBR you can use `sfdisk` to save the partition layout of your device to a file with `-d|--dump`

    # sfdisk -d /dev/sda > sda.dump

- to restore this layout
    
    # sfdisk /dev/sda < sda.dump
