Thumbor makes a distinction between 3 paths in which files can be found:

FILE_LOADER_ROOT_PATH:
- where the original files are dumped as is from an external source.
- they've not been treated yet.
- they have arbitrary names that have not yet been normalized by thumbor.
- defaults to /tmp

FILE_STORAGE_ROOT_PATH:
- where thumbor dumps its own normalized copy of the original files.
- they're identical in dimensions to the original, but might be smaller storage wise.
- these are the files thumbor uses as the basis for its further redimensioned copies.
- defaults to: /tmp/thumbor/storage

RESULT_STORAGE_ROOT_PATH:
- where thumbor dumps the various redimensioned versions of the original.
- defaults to: /tmp/thumbor/result_storage
