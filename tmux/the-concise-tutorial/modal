tmux is a modal tool, in a way somewhat similar to vim and emacs, two very popular and very keyboard-centric text editors.

In its default configuration it has one such trigger, which in tmux's parlance is called the "prefix" (defaults to Ctrl-b) and most tmux users tend to leave it at that, usually only going as far as remapping it to a different key combo (Ctrl-a is a popular remapping).
