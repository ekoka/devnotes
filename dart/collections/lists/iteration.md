- a list is an `Iterable` and support all its methods.
- iteration occurs over values in index order.
- changing a value does not affect iteration.
- changing the list's length between iteration steps causes a `ConcurrentModificationError`. Note that if the length changes and temporarily and is restored before continuing iteration, the iterator might not detect it.
