- use the `set_cookie()` method of the Response object

    >>> response.set_cookie(...)

- signature
    set_cookie(
        key, 
        value='', 
        max_age=None, 
        expires=None, 
        path='/', 
        domain=None,
        secure=False,
        httponly=False,
        samesite=None
    )

        key – name of cookie
        value – value of cookie
        max_age – number of seconds, or None (default) to last only as long client session
        expires – datetime object or UNIX timestamp
        path – limits cookie to given path, defaults to the whole domain
        domain – to set cross-domain cookie. 
            e.g. domain=".example.com" will set cookie that is readable by www.example.com, foo.example.com etc. Otherwise, cookie only readable by domain that set it.
        secure – If True, cookie will only be available via HTTPS
        httponly – disallow JavaScript to access cookie. An extension to the cookie standard and probably not supported by all browsers.
        samesite – Limits scope of cookie such that it will only be attached to requests if those requests are “same-site”.


- parameters are the same as in the cookie Morsel object in the Python standard library but it accepts unicode data, too.

- warning is raised if size of cookie header exceeds max_cookie_size, but header will still be set
