useful discovery rules
----------------------
- first current directory
- recursing into directories, unless they match `norecursedirs`
- in directories: test_*.py and *_test.py files and from those files:
    - test_* functions outside of class
    - test_* methods inside "Test" prefixed classes (without an `__init__` method)
