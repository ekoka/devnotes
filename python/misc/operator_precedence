- list is sorted from lowest to highest precedence
- operators on the same line group left to right, except for:
    - comparisons, including tests, which all have the same precedence and chain from left to right
    - exponentiation, which groups from right to left

    ---

    lambda
        - lambda expression

    if ... else
        - conditional expression

    or
        - boolean OR

    and
        - boolean AND

    not x
        - boolean NOT

    in, not in, is, is not, <, <=, >, >=, <>, !=, == 
        - comparisons, membership tests, identity tests
        - all have the same precedence 
        - chain from left to right
    |
        - bitwise OR

    ^
        - bitwise XOR

    &
        - bitwise AND

    <<, >>
        - shift

    +, -
        - addition, substraction

    *, /, //, %
        - multiplication, division, remainder


    +x, -x, ~x
        - positive, negative, bitwise NOT

    **
        - exponentiation

    x[index], x[index:index], x(arguments...), x.attribute
        - subscription, slicing, call, attribute reference
