# GOTCHA:
sometimes in recursive problems, you pass down the increasing index and calculate the length of the remaining unprocessed part of the array.
Be careful not to use that calculated length as the end value in the range, you more likely want to use the total length 

i.e. the following

    length = len(arr) - index
    for i in range(index, length):
        ...

should likely be rewritten as

    total_length = len(arr)
    length = total_length - index
    for i in range(index, total_length):
        ...
