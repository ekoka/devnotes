# we need the `add-apt-repository` command. In case it's missing install it

    $ sudo apt install software-properties-common python-software-properties

# now add a ppa for python3.6 in ubuntu 

    $ sudo add-apt-repository ppa:jonathonf/python-3.6

# update the sources

    $ sudo apt update

# install python3.6

    $ sudo apt install python3.6

# find out which symlink is resolved by `python3`

    $ which python3
    /usr/bin/python3

# find out more about it

    $ ls -l /usr/bin/python3
    lrwx...    ... /usr/bin/python3 -> /usr/bin/python3.5

# we need to add Python3.6 as an alternative candidate for Python3 with the `update-alternatives` command.

    The syntax is

    sudo update-alternatives --install <link> <name> <path> <priority>

    where 
        <link> is the symlink pointing to /etc/alternatives/<name>
        <name> is the master name for this link group
        <path> is the location of the alternative target file (where /etc/alternatives/<name> will point to)
        <priority> is an integer, higher number implies higher priority in automatic mode.

 
    $ sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/python3 python3 /usr/bin/python3.6 2

# now that python3.6 has been added as an alternative we can set it as the default for python3 as such

    $ sudo update-alternatives --config python3

Simply follow the instructions.

# after python3.6 has been set as the default in ubuntu 16.04 there was an issue with starting gnome terminal.

My solution was to install an alternative terminal, `Tilda` and go through similar steps to set it as the default.

    $ sudo apt install tilda
    $ sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/x-terminal-emulator x-terminal-emulator /usr/bin/tilda 20
    $ sudo update-alternatives --config x-terminal-emulator
