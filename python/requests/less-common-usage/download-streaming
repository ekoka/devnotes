------------------

    # get response with `stream=True`
    >>> r = requests.get('https://api.github.com/events', stream=True)

    # use this pattern to stream download
    >>> chunk_size = 20
    >>> filename = '/home/mike/mydownload.file'
    >>> with open(filename, 'wb') as fd:
    ...     for chunk in r.iter_content(chunk_size):
    ...         fd.write(chunk)
