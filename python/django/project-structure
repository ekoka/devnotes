Starting a project
-------------------
    $ django startproject myproject

Django will create a default web app with the same name. The structure
looks like this:

    /myproject
        manage.py
        /myproject # default web app
            settings.py
            urls.py
            wsgi.py


Let's rename the project directory to make things clearer

    $ mv myproject myproject_root

    /myproject_root
        manage.py
        /myproject
            settings.py
            urls.py
            wsgi.py

Create a new app
----------------

    $ cd myproject_root
    $ django manage.py startapp messaging 

Now the structure should look like this

    /myproject_root
        manage.py
        /myproject
            settings.py
            urls.py
            wsgi.py
        messaging/
            admin.py
            apps.py
            models.py
            tests.py
            views.py

    - admin.py is to register the app's models with the Django admin application.
    - apps.py is a configuration file common to all Django apps.
    - models.py where the models for the app are placed. 
            
- to register the app with the project, go to /myproject_root/myproject/settings.py, add the app's config to the INSTALLED_APPS list.

    INSTALLED_APPS = [
        'messaging.apps.MessagingConfig'
        'django.contrib.admin'
    ]
