- to create a URLconf we use the `django.urls.path()` function

    from django.urls import path
    from app1.views import some_view

    path('app1/', some_view)

    i.e. when user requests "http://mysite.com/app1/" run `app1.views.some_view()`

- a URL doesn't have to map to a view, it could map to any module in the Django app.
