e.g. syntax to configure and start uwsgi server
-----------------------------------------------

    $ uwsgi 
        --http :9090 # run app on port 9090
        --master # spawn a master process that can respawn your child processes when they die
        --processes 4 # spawn 4 child processes
        --threads 2 # each process should have 2 threads
        --wsgi-file foobar.py # file hosting the wsgi app
        --stats 127.0.0.1:9190 # start the stats subsystem host it at this address


using a config file
-------------------

    $ uwsgi --ini myconf.ini
    $ uwsgi --json myconf.json
    $ uwsgi --yaml myconf.yaml
    $ uwsgi --xml myconf.xml

    ...

    # content of myconf.ini

    [uwsgi]

    socket = 127.0.0.1:3031
    chdir = /home/mike/myproject
    pythonpath = ..
    wsgi-file = foobar.py
    callable = app
    processes = 4
    threads = 2
    stats = 127.0.0.1:3131
    virtualenv = <path>
    uid = mike # it's better not to let uwsgi run as root
    gid = webdev # it's better not to let uwsgi run as root
    harakiri = 30 # kill workers that have been blocked for more than 30 seconds
