automatic (non-interactive) renewals
------------------------------------
- Only for certs that do not require a manual interaction. If the cert was created with manual authentication, such as when specifying a TXT DNS challenge at _acme-challenge.example.com, this will likely not work, without specifying an authentication script (see: https://certbot.eff.org/docs/using.html#pre-and-post-validation-hooks).

    $ sudo certbot renew

manual renewals
---------------
- renewing a manual certs is done exactly the same way as when creating it

    $ certbot certonly \
        --manual \
        --preferred-challenges dns
        --server https://acme-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory \

        -d example.com \
        -d "*.example.com"
