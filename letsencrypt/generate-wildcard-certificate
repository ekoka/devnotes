    # you'll be asked to create a TXT record  "_acme-challenge.myserver.com" that returns a specific key that is given to you now. 

    Go to digitalocean, or linode, or whatever and create it.

    # You'll be asked again to create another TXT with a different key pointing again to "_acme-challenge.myserver.com". This is because you're creating certificates for two domains. Go again to digitalocean and do it. You can have 2 records with hte same name.


- flags and options

    certonly    :   issue a certificate, but don't install it automatically
    --manual    :   whether domain validation is manual (or through a shell script)
    --server    :   the certificate authority server (defaults to acme-v01). For wildcard certs it must be acme-v02 (https://acme-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory)
    --preferred-challenges: the ACME challenge type (such as dns, http). For wildcard certs the challenge must be "dns".

- verify that TXT record is live 

    $ dig _acme-challenge.myserver.com txt +noall +answer

- certificates location in ubuntu

    /etc/letsencrypt/live/myserver.com/

- todo: look into acme-dns
