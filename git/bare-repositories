working directory repository
----------------------------
- created with the `git init` command
- two things in the top level folder
    - a `.git` subfolder with all the git related revision history
    - a working tree, or checked out copies of the project files
- a working directory is meant for *working*. That is, if you intend to edit, delete, or add files to a project.

Bare repository
---------------
- created with the `git init --bare` command
- contains no working or checked out copy of the project files
- store revision history within the directory itself (i.e. their content would be equivalent to a working directory's `.git` subdirectory)
- they're customarily given a `.git` extension
- a bare repository is meant for *sharing*. For example, you could do some work on your own copy and then push your changes to a central bare repository (whose url typically ends with `.git`).
