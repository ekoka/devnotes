- it's probably best to prepend the block of lines to comment with `//-`, like when using Python's `#`

    //- In 
    //- vim 
    //- you'd 
    //- use 
    //- ctrl-v/shift-i

- note that `//-` will also comments everything directly underneath it that is indented

    //-
    
        everything 
        here 
        will
        be 
        commented
        ---
    but 
    this 
    will 
        not
