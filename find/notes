- print names of all the files in the directory
    
    $ find . -print

- arguments after the path names always start with a minus and tells find what to do once it finds a file

- find can be used with other commands

    # with the back-quote command substitution

        ls -ld `find . -print`

    # with xargs command. xargs executes its arguments as commands and reads standard input to specify arguments to those commands. The advantage of this method over the previous is that xargs knows the maximum number of arguments and does not exceeds that limit.

        find . -print | xargs ls -ld

- filter by file name : the `-name` option
    - can be used with a regex with meta-characters to filter for particular files.
    - these special characters need to be (back or single) quoted to allow the shell to pass them to `find` unchanged.

    find . -name *.o -print
    find . -name '*.o' -print
    find . -name '[a-zA-Z]*' -print

    - the path leading to the file is not matched, merely the name in the directory is

- filter by file type : the `-type` option
    - params:
        b : block special file
        c : character special file
        d : directory
        f : plain file
        p : named pipe file
        l : symlink
        s : socket
    - the most important to remember d, f, and l
    
        # recursively list files
        find . -type f -print | xargs ls -l

        # find all symlinks in a directory
        find . -type l -print | xargs ls -ld | awk '{print $10}'
        
- filter by file size : -size
    see: http://www.grymoire.com/Unix/Find.html#uh-7

- filter by time : -mtime, -atime, -ctime
    - filter by modified time: -mtime
        # files that are 7 days old
        find . -mtime 7 -print
        # or use a range. e.g. files older than 6 days but less than 8 days
        find . -mtime +6 -mtime -8 -print
    - filter by access time: -atime
        # file not read in 30 days or more
        find . -atime +30 -print
    - filter by time of change in ownership, permission or number of links: -ctime
        # files where permission changed 20 days ago
        find . -ctime 20 -print

- filter by number of links : -links

- filter by permission : -perm

- filter by owner or group : -user, -group 
    # find all files belonging to root
    find . -user root -perm -4000 -print
