Viewing basic log information
-----------------------------

- see all log entries, starting at oldest entry

    $ journalctl

    # if `journald` is configured to save previous boots records you'll see entries from current and previous boots

- use `-b` flag to see only entries from the current boot

    $ journalctl -b

- use `-k` to see only kernel messages

    $ journalctl -k

    # to see only those from current boot
    $ journalctl -k -b 

- see all journal entries from a unit

    $ journalctl -u nginx.service
    $ journalctl -u -b nginx.service
