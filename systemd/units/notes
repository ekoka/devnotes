- man page

    $ man systemd.unit

- in systemd a "unit" refers to any resource that the system knows how to operate on and manage. It's the primary object the system knows how to deal with.

- units are defined using configuration files called "unit files"

- example of features units are able to implement easily:
    - socket-based activation
    - bus-based activation
    - path-based activation
    - device-based activation
    - implicit dependency mapping
    - instances and templates
    - easy security hardening
    - drop-ins and snippets
    - more...

system's unit files
-------------------
- /lib/systemd/system/
    - hosts system's copy of units
    - these are generic unit files, often written by the upstream project's maintainers.
    - they're not meant to be edited (see /etc/systemd/system/)

overriding units files
----------------------
- /etc/systemd/system/
    - the best location to modify a unit's functions
    - supercede any of the other locations on the filesystem
    - putting a replacement file here is the safest and most flexible way

- to override only specific directives
