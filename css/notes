Specificity

#wrap #myStyle
{
    color: black;
}

---
will not work
#myStyle
{
    color: red;
}

----
will work because it's more specific
#wrap p#myStyle
{
    color: red;
}

calculating specificity
Element : 1 point
Classes : 10 points
Identifiers : 100 points
Inline Styling : 1000 points

============================================
Absolute and Relative positioning

---
default positioning is 'static'

    position : static;

---
Absolutely positioned elements are positioned in relation to their closest positioned parent.

---
Absolutely placing an image 100px from the top and 100px from the left of the window:

img
{
    position : absolute;
    top : 100px;
    left : 100px;
}

---
when relative positioned wrapper contain absolutely positioned element, we need to force their height

#wrapper
{
    position: relative;
    background: gray;
    height: 600px; /* forcing the height */
    ...
}
