- consider the following postgres container running inside a network 

    $ docker run --rm -d                                \
        --net[work] mynetwork                             \
        --name db                                       \ 
        -p 5433:5432                                    \ 
        -v pgdata:/var/lib/postgresql/data     \
        -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=password                   \
        postgres

Other services on the network can access the postgres server simply by specifying its name on the network. They don't need to provide a port. The mapping is done seamlessly.
