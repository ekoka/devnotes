#### Volumes

- stored in a part of the host filesystem managed by docker. Non-docker processes should not modify it.

    # e.g. on Linux
    /var/lib/docker/volumes/

### Bind mount

- may be stored anywhere on the host system, even important system files or directories.
- non-docker processes may modify them at any time.

### `tmpfs` mounts

- stored in the host system's memory only.
- never written to the host's fs.
- can be used for non-persistent or sensitive information. e.g. internally, Swarm services use `tmpfs` mounts to mount secrets into a service's container.

### Tips on bind mounts or volumes
- if you mount an empty volume into a directory in the container in which files or directories exist, these files or directories are propagated (i.e. copied) into the volume.
- if you start a container and specify a volume which does not already exist, and empty volume is created for you. This can be a good way to pre-populate data that another container needs
