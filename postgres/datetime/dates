Types
------

- DATETIME / TIMESTAMP 
    contain year, month, day, hour, minute, second and millisecond for all usefule date and time values (4713BC to over 100,000 AD).

- DATE 
    simplified integer based representation of a date defining only year, month and day.

- INTERVAL
    structured value showing a period of time, including any/all years, months, weeks, days, hours, minutes, seconds, and milliseconds. 
    e.g. 
        '1 day' 
        '42 minutes 10 seconds'
        '2 years'
    
TIMEZONES
---------
All timestamp value carry TIMEZONE data you can ignore if you don't need them.


INTERVALS
---------
- the difference between two TIMESTAMP is always an INTERVAL

    > TIMESTAMP '1999-12-30' - TIMESTAMP '1999-12-11' = INTERVAL '19 days'

- you may add or subtract an INTERVAL to a TIMESTAMP to produce another TIMESTAMP

    > TIMESTAMP '1999-12-11' + INTERVAL '19 days' = TIMESTAMP '1999-12-30'

- you may add or subtract two INTERVALS

    > INTERVAL '1 month' + INTERVAL '1 month 3 days' = INTERVAL '2 months 3 days'

- to only divide INTERVALS consisting of days, hours, minutes and seconds

    > EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM INTERVAL '4 hours') / EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM INTERVAL '2 hours') = 2

- many larger INTERVAL values, like the calendar values they reflect, are not constant in length when expressed as small INTERVAL values
    TIMESTAMP '2001-07-02' + INTERVAL '1 month' = TIMESTAMP '2001-08-02'
    TIMESTAMP '2001-07-02' + INTERVAL '31 days' = TIMESTAMP '2001-08-02'

    but

    TIMESTAMP '2001-02-02' + INTERVAL '1 month' = TIMESTAMP '2001-03-02'
    TIMESTAMP '2001-02-02' + INTERVAL '31 days' = TIMESTAMP '2001-03-05' 

Operations with DATES
---------------------
- the difference between two DATES is always an INTEGER representing the number of DAYS difference

    DATE '1999-12-30' - DATE '1999-12-11' = INTEGER 19

- you may add or subtract an INTEGER to a DATE to produce another DATE
    
    DATE '1999-12-11' + INTEGER 19 = DATE '1999-12-30'


- displaying DATE as text, or convert text into a DATE or INTERVAL
    # TODO
    to_date(), to_char() and interval()

- getting the month as an integer out of a date
    # TODO
    extract()

- convert date to Unix timestamp

    EXTRACT(EPOCH from TIMESTAMP '2014-01-28 00:00:00')
    EXTRACT(EPOCH from my_timestamp_field)
