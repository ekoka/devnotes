- non-deterministic functions are not suitable for indexes. That is, functions whose results are influenced by changing factors such as date, random number generator, temperature, environment variables, etc.

- to be used in indexes the functions must be deterministic and must be declared as `IMMUTABLE`


    CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION fnc(param1 text, param2 int)
    RETURNS text
    AS
    $BODY$

        ... definition

    $BODY$
    LANGUAGE sql
    IMMUTABLE;

- note that postgres cannot verify that a function is immutable, it trusts the developer for that.
