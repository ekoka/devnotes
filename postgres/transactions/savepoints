- to selectively commit or discard some of the statements within a transaction use `savepoints`.

    BEGIN;
        statement;
        statement;

        SAVEPOINT savepoint_a;

        statement;

        SAVEPOINT savepoint_b;

        statement;
        
        ROLLBACK TO savepoint_a; # moves back to 
        statement;
    COMMIT;

- You can roll back to a savepoint by using `ROLLBACK TO <savepoin>` and resume work on the transaction from that point on.

- after rolling back to a savepoint, it stays defined and can be rolled back to again later. Keep in mind, however, that rolling back to a savepoint discards all other savepoints defined after it.

- ROLLBACK TO is also the only way to regain control of a transaction that was put in aborted state due to an error, short of rolling it back entirely. 

- to release a savepoint (perhaps because you believe you won't need to roll back to it and want to free some resources). Like rolling back, releasing a savepoint also discards other savepoints defined after it.
