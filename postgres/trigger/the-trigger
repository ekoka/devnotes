the trigger
-----------

- to create a trigger use the `CREATE TRIGGER` statement

    CREATE TRIGGER trigger_name {BEFORE | AFTER | INSTEAD OF} {event [OR ...]}
    ON table_name
    [FOR [EACH] {ROW | STATEMENT}]
    EXECUTE PROCEDURE my_triggered_action();

- `event` could be INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, TRUNCATE

- trigger can fire BEFORE or AFTER event

- INSTEAD OF is used only on views, for INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE

- FOR EACH {ROW|STATEMENT} determines whether it's a ROW or STATEMENT level trigger

- e.g.

    CREATE TRIGGER last_name_changes
    BEFORE UPDATE
    ON employees
    FOR EACH ROW
    EXECUTE PROCEDURE log_last_name_changes();

- for TRUNCATE events triggers should be marked FOR EACH STATEMENT

triggers on views
-----------------

- BEFORE and AFTER triggers on a view must be marked FOR EACH STATEMENT
- INSTEAD OF triggers are used only on views, for INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE
- INSTEAD OF triggers should be marked FOR EACH ROW
