#### What is Collation?
- _collation_ relates to how text data is sorted and compared in a database.
- it specifies the sorting rules for characters.
- when running a query with an `ORDER BY` clause, collation determines whether or not upper and lower case letters are to be treated the same.
- depending on the DBMS collation can be specified at the server, database, table, column, expression (e.g. query), and identifier level.
