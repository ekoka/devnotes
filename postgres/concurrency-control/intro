Multiversion Concurrency Control (MVCC): 
---------------------------------------
- while querying a database, each transaction sees a snapshot of data
- by eschewing the locking methodologies MVCC minimizes lock contention and allows for reasonable performance in multiuser environments.

- locks acquired for reading do not conflict with locks acquired for writiong. Thus reading never blocks writing and writing never blocks reading.

- table and row level locking facilities are also available when full transaction isolation is not needed.

- note however that proper use of MVCC generally provide better performance than locks.
