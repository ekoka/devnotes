- executing a simple search

    SELECT 'a fat cat sat on a mat and ate a fat rat'::tsvector @@ 'cat & rat'::tsquery;
    ---
    true

    SELECT 'fat & cow'::tsquery @@ 'a fat cat sat on a mat and ate a fat rat'::tsvector;
    ---
    false

- a search matches "search terms" to a "searched document"

- a *tsvector* is not just raw text, but a text type that contains already normalized lexemes from a *document*.

- similarly, a *tsquery* text contains search terms, as already-normalized lexemes, that may be combined using AND (&), OR(|), NOT (!) and FOLLOWED BY (<->) operators.

- a number of functions help to convert ordinary text types to these search optimized types: 

    - to_tsvector: convert text to tsvector (i.e. parse and normalize document)
    - to_tsquery: convert text to tsquery
    - plainto_tsquery
    - phraseto_tsquery
