- getting an execution plan is done with the `EXPLAIN` command

- EXPLAIN
    - on statements without bind parameters

        EXPLAIN SELECT 1

    - on statements with bind parameters

        # prepare a statement and name it `stmt`
        PREPARE stmt(int) AS SELECT $1
        # explain the statement executed passing `1` as param
        EXPLAIN EXECUTE stmt(1)

        # finally, deallocate prepared statement
        DEALLOCATE stmt

- EXPLAIN plan output

                    QUERY PLAN
    ------------------------------------------
     Result  (cost=0.00..0.01 rows=1 width=0)

    - 'Result' is the operation's name
    - the related 'cost' is split into two parts:
        - the startup cost 
        - the total cost if all rows are retrieved

- EXPLAIN has two options VERBOSE and ANALYZE

- ANALYZE 
    - records actual timing and row count
    - actually executes INSERT, DELETE, and UPDATE operations
    - should probably be used in the context of a transaction
    
    BEGIN
    EXPLAIN ANALYZE EXECUTE stmt(1)
    
                    QUERY PLAN
    ------------------------------------------
     Result  (cost=0.00..0.01 rows=1 width=0) \ 
        (actual time=0.002..0.002 rows=1 loops=1)
     Total runtime: 0.020 ms

    ROLLBACK
